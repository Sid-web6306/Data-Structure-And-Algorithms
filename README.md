Hey Folks, Do you Know the Good Code ???ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”If you see Someone's code How do you Know The code is Good? To understand Here are the two Things Are as Follows->ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

1.Code should be Readable. 
2.Code Should be Scalable which includes Time Complexity And Space Complexity[BIG O].

And Here comes the cheatSheet for Time and Space Complexity which helps easy to understand and for revision.
